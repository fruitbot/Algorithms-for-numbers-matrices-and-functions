# Algorithms and methods to manipulate numbers, matrixs and functions

This projet contains 10 mini projects which are classic algorithms and methods to manipulate or to solve matrixs, functions.





## Brief descriptions of each mini project


* **Karatsuba** A multiplication algorithm(n^1.585) which is faster than normal multiplication method in school(at n^2)

* **Juxtaposed**  By employing other scheduling algorithms, this one aims to find the best partition of machines to allocate a list of tasks of two types.

* **Greedy Cluster**  analyses the compatibility of different tasks, and cluster the tasks which are interfered the least when they are put on the same machine. 

* **PTAS**  Polynomial time approximation scheme, which tries to schedule the tasks in the most optimal way whose time complexity is polynomial instead of exponential.



### Others

* **tkinter** tkinter is used in this project to generate the graphical interface which shows the allocation clearly and efficiently.

* **Matplotlib** By controling the amount of tasks and machines or the coefficient of compatibility, it compares the validity, efficiency and complexity of different algorithms.
