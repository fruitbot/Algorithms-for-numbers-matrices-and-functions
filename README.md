# Algorithms and methods to manipulate numbers, matrixs and functions

This projet contains 11 mini projects which are classic algorithms and methods to manipulate or to solve matrixs, functions.





## Brief descriptions of each mini project


* **Karatsuba.c** a multiplication algorithm(n^1.585) which is faster than normal multiplication method in school(at n^2)

* **Archimedes.c**  a method for approximating the value of pi.

* **Rationals.c**  a series of functions which manipulate rational numbers. 

* **Euclide.c**  a set of functions which carry out Euclid's method, then calculate modular multiplicative inverse, which allows us to practice Bézout's theorem. 

* **Matrix.c** a series of functions which manipulate matrix with real numbers. 

* **Strassen.c**  Strassen's algorithm to for approximating the value of pi.

* **Rationals.c**  a series of functions which manipulate rational numbers.
