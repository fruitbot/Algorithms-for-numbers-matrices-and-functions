# Algorithms and methods to manipulate numbers, matrixes and functions

This projet contains 11 mini projects which are classic algorithms and methods to manipulate or to solve matrixes, functions.





## Brief descriptions of each mini project


* **Karatsuba.c** a multiplication algorithm(at n^1.585) which is faster than normal multiplication method in school(at n^2)

* **Archimedes.c**  a method for approximating the value of pi.

* **Rationals.c**  a series of functions which manipulate rational numbers. 

* **Euclide.c**  a set of functions which carry out Euclid's method, then calculate modular multiplicative inverse, which allows us to practice BÃ©zout's theorem. 

* **Matrix.c** a series of functions which manipulate matrixes with real numbers. 

* **Strassen.c**  a multiplication algorithm for matrixes (at n^2.807) which is faster than normal multiplication method(at n^3).

* **GaussianElimination.c** an algorithm for solving linear systems.

* **LU_Decomposition.c**  an algorithm which allow computers to solve linear systems easily.

* **Polynomial.c** a series of functions which manipulate polynomials.

* **Horner.c**  transforms the monomial form of a polynomial into a computationally efficient form.

* **Find_Functions_Zero.c**  use bisection method or Newton method to find zero of a function.

* **Polynomial_Interpolation.c** implementation of polynomial interpolation.
